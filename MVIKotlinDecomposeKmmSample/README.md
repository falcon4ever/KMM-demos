# Decompose/MVIKotlin/Ktor KMM Sample

This demo app is an example of how we can use [Decompose](https://arkivanov.github.io/Decompose/getting-started/installation/), [MVIKotlin](https://arkivanov.github.io/MVIKotlin/) and [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) to build a KMM based app. 

## Implementation notes

The demo implements Decompose `components`, a MVIKotlin `Store` and uses `ktor` to fetch random Ron Swanson quotes.

## Build env
This demo was created using Android Studio Bumblebee 2021.1.1 Beta 1 / XCode 13.1
